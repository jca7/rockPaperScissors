// 1) Create an array to store "Rock" , "Paper" and "Scissors"
const options = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
// 2) create a function that randomly generates a number then use that to randomly select an item from the array above

// 3) write a function that takes 2 parameters: playerSelection & computerSelection 
// create logic on what beats what (Rock beat scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, if same = tie)
// compare playerSelection vs. computerSelection to see who wins or if there is a tie
// return a string that declares the winner of the round or tie 

// 4) write a function called game() put the previous function in here
// this function should keep score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
